# ResNet ver TorchVision for Tensorflow2

This is an implementation of "ResNet ver TorchVision" on Keras and Tensorflow.

The implementation is based on [official implementation](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/resnet.py).

## Model

- Model
  * ResNet-18
  * ResNet-34
  * ResNet-50
  * ResNet-101
  * ResNet-152
  * ResNeXt-50
  * ResNeXt-101
  * Wide-ResNet-50
  * Wide-ResNet-101
- Pre-trained weight
  * Imagenet(The pre-trained weights are converted from [official weight](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/resnet.py).)

## Requirements

- Python 3
- tensorflow 2
- torch 1.1â–² (Use the pre-trained weights)
